As I am currently part of a student rocketry team working with a multitude of valves and sensors, I would be interested in learning how to write a python program capable of reading data from a sensor and writing it into a file in real time. The sensor could for example be a potentiometer measuring the voltage used by a servo motor to determine its position. 
As a proof of concept, this project will generate a stream of serial data and send it to a COM port in the same way an arduino connected to a sensor would. The functions in the program will use the pySerial library to read the data generated by the program from the COM port, plot it and save into a file in real time. The expected output of the program is a file with the sensor data.
