As I am currently part of a student rocketry team working with a multitude of valves and sensors, I would be interested in learning how to write a python program capable of reading data from a sensor and writing it into a file in real time. The sensor could possibly be a dipstick measuring the amount of oxidiser in an enclosed tank. One option would be to use a Feather board coded in micropython to read the data from the hardware circuit. If I am not allowed to use micropython for this project, the sensor data could be logged into serial and I could write a python program that uses the pySerial library to read it that way. The expected output of the program is a file with the sensor data.
